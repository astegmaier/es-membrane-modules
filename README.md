# es-membrane-modules

This is an experimental fork of Alexander J. Vincent's [es-membrane](https://github.com/ajvincent/es-membrane) project, which hasn't been updated in a while. My goals for now are...

- to create a more "modern" javascript package that can be consumed as an es-module by a bundler. ("modern" is subjective, but I'm indexing this to the needs and patterns in the project I'm considering using `es-membrane` in).
- provide typescript definitions
- provide a playground for me to iterate on improvements (and share them with others).
- create a working deployment pipeline in case I want to use this in production projects
- otherwise faithfully reproduce (for now) the behavior of [the last-published version (`0.9`) of es-membrane](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-membrane) (published in 2018).
